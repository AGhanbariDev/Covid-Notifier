# Covid-Notifier
Amidst the Covid-19 Pandemic, I created a program that would notify my desktop about the number of Covid cases by web scraping a website I picked. 

This was an enjoyable project beacause I was able to gather important data and it felt like a more real-world program that could actually impact people positively. 

It currently does not work anymore because the website changed, messing up the web scraping process.
